“The purpose of software is to make the complex appear simple.”

I am a software engineer focused on creating clarity from chaos. I believe the best code isn't just functional, it's understandable.
- My primary focus is forging Kí, a suite of developer tools designed to unlock simplicity in the tech landscape.
- I build open-source keys, not just tools. Each library is crafted to solve a specific, often frustrating, local development challenge.
- I believe in demystifying the development process through open-source. Code should be a blueprint, not a black box.
- I use JavaScript and Python as my primary tool for structuring solutions and bringing clarity to problems.
- Open to collaborating on any interesting enigma. If you're building for the local ecosystem, let's connect.
